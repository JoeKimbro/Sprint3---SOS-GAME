Implement all the features that support a human player to play a simple or general SOS game against a human opponent and refactor your existing code if necessary. The minimum features include choosing the game mode (simple or general), choosing the board size, setting up a new game, making a move (in a simple or general game), and determining if a simple or general game is over.

If your code for Sprint 2 has not considered class hierarchy, it is time to refactor your code.
